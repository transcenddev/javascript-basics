Divide a programming problem into simpler, analogous pieces.
Solve the problem by combining solutions to simpler pieces.

key takeaways:
problems are combinations of simpler problems

ex.
the computer only knows how to eat a single spoon of cereal.
how can a computer eat a bowl of a cereal?
by eating more single spoon of cereal


# General Iterative Framework

function EatCereal(amount)
{
  if( simple case ) 
  {
    solution for simple case
  }

  else 
  {
    Divide into simpler case
    EatCereal ( simpler case )
  }
}

recurssion approach becuase most complex problem depends on solutions to the simpler pieces, recurssion creates queue of jobs waiting to be completed.
