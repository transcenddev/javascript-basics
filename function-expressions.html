<!-- 
Summary

Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place
of the code. 

If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main
code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”. 

Function declaration is visible everywhere.

Function expressions are like functions that are inside assigned to variables 

We can use function declaration to organize code because we can call function before it gets declare
but if it not suited we can use function expressions as the code above. 

Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them
